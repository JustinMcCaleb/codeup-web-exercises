============ JavaScript Cheat Sheet ============

====== Data Types ======

    Primitive
        -boolean    // true/false
        -number     // 10, 3.14
        -string     // "Hello World"
        -undefined  // unassigned variables have this value and type
        -null       // a special keyword denoting a lack of value

    Complex
        -object

    Special object types
        -function
        -array

====== Operators ======

    -Operators are special symbols in the language that produce a value from the operands they operate on. Combined with primitive types, we can produce expressions.

    3 + 5
    3 & 5 // Operands
    +   // Operator

    typeof // is a special operator that will produce a STRING that contains the type of the operand it is used on.
        typeof 42 // will result in the STRING 'number'

===== Arithmetic Operators =====

    remember PEMDAS

    + // addition
    - // subtraction
    * // multiplication
    / // division
    % // produces a remainder after dividing two numbers

===== String Concatenation =====

    use the

===== Loops =====

    while loop - great for iterating until a condition is met
    do-while - great for iterating until a condition is met
    for loop - great for doing something n times
    break - great for stopping iteration when some condition is met
    continue - great for skipping certain code per iteration when a condition is met

    While loop syntax:

        while(conditionIsTrue) {
            do something...
        }

        Used to repeat a block of code until condition changes to break the loop. Likely used when the number of iterations is unknown.


===== Objects =====

    Two types of data that can be set to an object;
        - properties: data set to an object
        - methods

===== Browser Object Model =====

        - BOM
        - The BOM allows javascript to interact with the web browser

    ===== Window Object =====

            - the core of the Browser Object Model
            - the window object represents the JavaScript Global object, that means that any variables or functions declared in the global scope become part of the window object

    ===== System Dialogs =====

        - alert(), confirm(), and prompt() are provided by the browser and are made available through the window object. Since the window object represents the global JS object, the methods can be called without mentioning the window object.

    ===== Intervals and Timeouts =====

        - setInterval()
            - allows code to be executed at a specified time interval. The code will continue executing at the given interval until the method clearInterval() is called.

            'use strict';

            // this code will produce a console log every second
            // when count >= max, the interval is cancelled, and the logging will stop

            var count = 0;
            var max = 10;
            var interval = 1000; // interval time in milliseconds

            var intervalId = setInterval(function () {
                if (count >= max) {
                    clearInterval(intervalId);
                    console.log('All done');
                } else {
                    count++;
                    console.log('Repeating this line ' + count);
                }
            }, interval);


====== jQuery ======

        - JS library that simplifies DOM manipulation
        - For class we will use version 2
        - In jQuery, we commonly use the dollar sign $ to access the library
        - $ this symbol is used to reference the jQuery library

        -Document ready
            - $(document).ready(function() {
                alert('The DOM has finished loading');
            });

        - Selectors

            //Selects all elements with the class of .main-headings, and the element with the id of books
            - $('.main-headings, #books')

            - $('#book-welcome').html();
                - will return the inner HTML of the element with an ID of book-welcome

        - Mouse Events

        - Keyboard Events

            - .keydown() : Binds an event handler to the 'keydown' JavaScript event or trigger that event on an element.

                $( 'selector' ).keydown( handler function )

            - .keypress() : Binds an event handler to the 'keypress' JavaScript event or trigger that event on an element.

                - works the same as .keydown() BUT, modifier keys (shift, control, escape, etc) will NOT trigger a .keydown() event.

                $( 'selector' ).keypress( handler function)

            - .keyup() : Binds an event handler to the 'keyup' JavaScript event or trigger that event on an element.

                $( 'selector' ).keyup( handler function )

            - .on() : All the jQuery events we have covered so far can also be listened to using the .on() method. This method takes the event listener type and a callback function

                - the .on() can have multiple arguments which
                * - allows you to use an event on a dynamically added (something added to the document AFTER page load) element.

                .on('keydown', function() {});

            - .off() : the .

            - .append()
                - just adds an element to the END of a list. It does NOT replace.

            - .prepend()
                - adds an element to the beginning of parent element.

            - .html() — Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements or set the HTML contents of every matched element.

            - .css() — Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements or set one or more CSS properties for every matched element.

            - .addClass() — Adds the specified class(es) to each of the set of matched elements.

            - .removeClass() — Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements.

            - .toggleClass() — Add or remove one or more classes from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class’ presence or the value of the switch argument.

            - .each() — Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.

            - .first() — Reduce the set of matched elements to the first in the set.

            - .last() — Reduce the set of matched elements to the final one in the set.

            - .parent() — Get the parent of each element in the current set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.

            - .children() — Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector.

            - .next() — Get the immediately following sibling in the set of matched elements.

            return '' + input1 + input2;
        }
