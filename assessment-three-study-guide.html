    ## JavaScript Loops, Arrays, and Objects Checklist
    The following are several points of competency and skill that are intended to help identify areas of additional practice and study. Not all answers are found in the Codeup curriculum.

        ### Knowledge
    In addition to the concepts from the previous assessment,
    - [X] I can differentiate between the various loops of JavaScript.

            - While loop:
                - Will iterate through the loop when a condition is met and remains true. It will NOT start the loop if the condition is not met to begin with.
                - Used when you want to continue the loop until a certain condition is met.

            - Do-While loop:
                - Will always run through the loop AT LEAST ONCE before checking the condition and deciding to keep iterating or to terminate the loop.
                - Used when you don't know how many times the loop needs to run AND you want it run AT LEAST ONCE.

            - For loop: used

    - [ ] I can identify the use case for break and continue in loops.
    - [X] I can identify an array in JavaScript.
    - [ ] I know how to iterate through an array in JavaScript.

    - [ ] I know the various parts of an object in JavaScript.
    - [ ] I have familiarized myself with the Math object, and its various methods and properties.

        ### Skills
